# waku-daemon

`waku-daemon` is the standalone process that hosts Waku's provider sessions.
It binds to loopback only, authenticates clients with `WAKU_DAEMON_TOKEN`, and
prints one JSON readiness record to stdout containing its address, protocol
version, and process ID.

```text
WAKU_DAEMON_TOKEN=<secret> waku-daemon --bind 127.0.0.1:0 [--parent-pid PID]
```

Waku Desktop supervises this process. Debug builds use the feature-gated
`waku-debug-daemon` target at `target/debug/waku-debug-daemon`, so rebuilding
provider code replaces only the daemon. Release distributions place the signed
`waku-daemon` binary beside the desktop executable.
